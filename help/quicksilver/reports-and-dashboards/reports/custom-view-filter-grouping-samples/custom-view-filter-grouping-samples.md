<div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<h2>Hour</h2>
<p><a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-combined-task-issue-details-hour-list.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">View: combined task and issue details in an Hour list</a> </p>
<p>An Hour view which combines the Task and Issue name columns, as well as the Task and Issue work required (Planned Hours) using the <code>sharecol=true</code> line. This allows you to display the Planned Hours for both Tasks and Issues in one column. Because each hour entry can only be associated with either a Task or an Issue, you always have just one value in the shared column. In the case of an hour entry on a task, the issue reference will be null, and vice versa.</p>
<p><a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-hours-parent-task-information.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">View: hours with parent task information</a> </p>

<p>This Project view shows a list of users and roles assigned to the project team.</p> 
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE:&nbsp;View: Business Case Export&nbsp;- hidden, because this view is not supported anymore.This was originally created to provide an option to export the business case directly from an emailed report -- the recipient will receive a report of new business cases created in the previous week each Monday morning and be able to export the business case PDF without having to navigate through the Workfront interface.) </p>

<p>This Project view displays project information in a two row format. It employs the use of the <code>sharecol=true</code> line to combine multiple fields under the same column header. Additionally, it utilizes place holder columns that hold an HTML line break tag (<br/>) that forces the description to reside below the project name, for example.</p> 
<div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<p>(NOTE: Filter: Owned By Me Project Ideas and Requests&nbsp;- hidden because this is available from the UI</p>
<p>The following filter displays projects in the Idea and Requested states where the logged in user is project owner (Project Manager).This is an important filter to have in your list of available filters because often project managers are not the people creating the projects they will be assigned to work on.) </p>
