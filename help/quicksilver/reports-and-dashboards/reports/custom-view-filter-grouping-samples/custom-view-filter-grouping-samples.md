本節提供您可以在Adobe Workfront帳戶中使用的自訂檢視、篩選器和群組的範例。 除非另有指定，否則無法僅使用標準模式介面建置這些範例，而只能使用文字模式介面建置。 如需文字模式的詳細資訊，請參閱[文字模式概觀](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/understand-text-mode.md)。

<div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<h2>Hour</h2>
<p><a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-combined-task-issue-details-hour-list.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">View: combined task and issue details in an Hour list</a> </p>
<p>An Hour view which combines the Task and Issue name columns, as well as the Task and Issue work required (Planned Hours) using the <code>sharecol=true</code> line. This allows you to display the Planned Hours for both Tasks and Issues in one column. Because each hour entry can only be associated with either a Task or an Issue, you always have just one value in the shared column. In the case of an hour entry on a task, the issue reference will be null, and vice versa.</p>
<p><a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-hours-parent-task-information.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">View: hours with parent task information</a> </p>

<p>This Hour grouping organizes hours by the sponsor of the project where the hours reside. The standard interface for Hour groupings does not provide a mapping to the project sponsor; it must be done through the Text Mode interface.</p>
<h2>Issue</h2>
<p><a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-issues-approval-information.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">View: issues with approval information</a> </p>

<div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<p>(NOTE: Luke: View: Entry Information (Edit)&nbsp;-</p>
<p>Hiding this article as everything in this view except for the Edit icons can be achieved in the UI. The icon is no longer supported.</p>

<p>This is the Detail Information issue view provided with Workfront. The 'Edit' icon has been added to the second column.</p>
<p>View: Issue URL as External Link&nbsp;-&nbsp;Hiding this as this can be done from the UI and the URL column is no longer supported the way it is coded here.</p>
<p>This issue view displays the URL field for the issue as a _blank target.) </p>

<p>This Issue view displays the name and percentage complete of the resolving object of the Issue, allowing the issue originator to have insight into the progress of the issue even without access to the resolving task or project.</p> 
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE:&nbsp;Luke: Program - hidden because the view is not supported in the new UI anymore)</p>
<h2>Project</h2>

<p>This Project view shows a list of users and roles assigned to the project team.</p> 
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE:&nbsp;View: Business Case Export&nbsp;- hidden, because this view is not supported anymore.This was originally created to provide an option to export the business case directly from an emailed report -- the recipient will receive a report of new business cases created in the previous week each Monday morning and be able to export the business case PDF without having to navigate through the Workfront interface.) </p>
<p><a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/filter-current-projects-pending-approval.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Filter: display your current projects pending approval</a> </p>

<p>This Project view displays project information in a two row format. It employs the use of the <code>sharecol=true</code> line to combine multiple fields under the same column header. Additionally, it utilizes place holder columns that hold an HTML line break tag (<br/>) that forces the description to reside below the project name, for example.</p> 
<div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<p>(NOTE: Filter: Owned By Me Project Ideas and Requests&nbsp;- hidden because this is available from the UI</p>
<p>The following filter displays projects in the Idea and Requested states where the logged in user is project owner (Project Manager).This is an important filter to have in your list of available filters because often project managers are not the people creating the projects they will be assigned to work on.) </p>
